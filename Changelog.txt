- [2023.02.03; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: When creating a remote update task to
  update only signature files, when there aren't any outdated signatures, but
  other outdated components are detected, Cronable would report it as an error,
  instead of the more appropriate response that there simply aren't currently
  any outdated signature files; Fixed.

=== Version/Release 1.1.0 ===
MINOR RELEASE.

- [2017.11.05; Minor code change and bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Refactored some code
  and fixed a bug whereby unexpected responses could report as everything being
  already up-to-date instead of displaying an error message. Also improved
  status message aesthetic.

- [2017.12.06; NEW FEATURE; Maikuolan]: Added the new method "localUpdate" and
  the ability to perform updates locally. This new ability requires package
  versions CIDRAM >= 1.3.0 or phpMussel >= 1.2.0 (older versions won't be able
  to be updated using this method). Package loaders must also be updated.

- [2017.12.12; Bug-fix; Maikuolan]: Typo in the "localUpdate" method; Fixed.
